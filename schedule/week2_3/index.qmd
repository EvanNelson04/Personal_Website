## Sprint

A short, focused period (typically 2 weeks) where the team delivers a specific goal.

**Sprint Lifecycle:**

- *Daily Stand-Ups*: Stay aligned and address blockers.
- *Sprint Review*: Present the increment to stakeholders.
- *Sprint Retrospective*: Reflect and improve the process.

### Daily Stand-Up Meetings

A 5-15 minute meeting to synchronize the team and identify blockers.

**Format:**

- What did I do yesterday?
- What will I do today?
- What's blocking me?

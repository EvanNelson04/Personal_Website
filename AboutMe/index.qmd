### Background

I was born July 1st in the small town of Scituate, Massachusetts. Grew up playing every sport and spending
as much time outside as I physically could. I went to school at Scituate Highschool which was about 1 minute
down the road from my house. In highschool I started to find a love for computers, learning technology
worked, installing computers and just everything about technology.

### Educational Background
During my junior and senior years of highschool I was able to take 2 intro to computer science clases, one
of them being an AP class. This helped me in learning an intro to coding specifically in java. We would complete
different activities and tasks. Very simple as these were introductory clases. This progressed into wanting to
potetnially study this into college as it really intreagued me. I decided to go to Allegheny College in Pennsylvania
because they have a great computer science department.

### Tennis

I have been playing tennis most of my life. Tennis was a sport for me where I could really compete in and have a
chance to win some tournaments. Tennis for me was a distractor in life, it allowed me to focus on bettering myself
everytime I stepped onto the court. Tennis brought me many things including my best friends still and becoming a
better person. I was lucky to have amazing coaches in my life who saw my potential which was able to bring me to
play college tennis at Allegheny College. I was a 2 year starter for the team and helped win 2 Conference Titles
and bring the team to 2 NCAA Tournament appearences. A shoulder injury riddled my whole career which forced me to quit
at the start of my junior year.
